# Data-Analytics-Final-Project

This project looks at the words used in speeches by US presidential candidate from 1992 to 2008 and wehether the choice of words used during the campaign makes a difference in winning an election. Possibly based on the character or image created by candidates. 

The data is in a document-word matrix, where the word occurences (rates) were counted and divided by the ength of each speech so that the speeches could be compared. 
Each word has a corresponding "parts of speech tag" or Stanford tag that describes the type of word it is. The data associated with "deception words" are words that give the illusion of a better character than one is and are only their occurences in the speech. 

This report aims to find:
1. A model with the highest prediction accuracy for the likelihood of winning the US presidential elections.
2. Words associated with winning speeches and any good strategies to win the elections.
3. What role does deceptive language have in winning the US elections?


This report is a limited exploration of US political speeches, it properly outlines the procedures taken to tackle a large scale data analytics project. 




This exploration used KNIME and Microsoft Excel to format and develop models. 

The ZIP folder includes the entire KNIME workflow to achieve the models and conclusions.
